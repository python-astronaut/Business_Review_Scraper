# Bussiness_Review_Scraper
A easy way to manage reviews for your business 


Another project I have made, being bored. Essentially, I heard someone in the office complaining that it was hard writing out the reviews because, at my work, there were two methods. One was that they would copy and paste the reviews into a Word document and print them, or sometimes write them out on sticky notes. Then, they would analyze them and manually sort them into piles. It was at least two days of work and such a long waste of time; there had to be another way.

So, I made this. In essence, it is a review scraper that will take a website's reviews that have been converted into a CSV file and then will spit out a graph to show the reviews in terms of positive and negative on a scale from 1-5 (standard Google scale). With that in mind, it will also log common words for the good and bad reviews so you can see what people really enjoy and what they hate.

With this information, you can better assess your business. Now, with regards to this program, though it currently works off a CSV file, it could easily be modified to have it work directly with the website. I put a placeholder for API functionality. Currently, it is a lot in a bar graph, which will convert to a histogram with enough reviews and create smaller buckets.

That said, it was really fun to work on, and I thoroughly enjoyed working with Matplotlib and Pandas to move through the data. Like all of my programs, they are registered under an open license, so feel free to use the software if you wish; just please credit my repo. Thank you so much. I hope this helps you.
