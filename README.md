# Bussiness_Review_Scraper
A easy way to manage reviews for your business 


This project was developed to address the common challenge of inefficiently analyzing customer reviews. Something I saw a college working on one day in the office. Traditional methods, such as manually writing and sorting of feedback, are very time consuming and labor intensive, which I saw many times required multiple workdays to complete.

To streamline this process, I created a review analysis tool. In essence, it is a review scraper that processes website reviews from a CSV file, generating a graph of positive and negative sentiment on a standard 1-5 scale (optimized for google). Furthermore, the program identifies and logs frequently occurring words within both positive and negative reviews. This functionality allows the user to gain deeper insights into specific aspects that customers appreciate or dislike, enabling a more targeted assessment of business performance.

With this information, you can better assess your business. Now, with regards to this program, though it currently works off a CSV file, it could easily be modified to have it work directly with the website. I put a placeholder for API functionality. Currently, it's in a bar graph, however this could easily be changed to be a histogram or scatter plot whatever graph you would want to reprisent the data better.

That said, it was really fun to work on, and I thoroughly enjoyed working with Matplotlib and Pandas to move through the data. This software is made available under an open license; you are welcome to utilize it, with the request that appropriate credit be given to my repository. It is my hope that this tool proves beneficial to you in your business there are some photos down below which better showcase it in action :)
